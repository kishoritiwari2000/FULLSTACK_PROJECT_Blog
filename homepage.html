                                Step 1:
                                <br>
                                 Determine the Purpose of the Website Content
                                You can’t write good content for a website without knowing why you’re writing it.

                                Is the website content selling a product? Is it meant to attract new clients? Is it building traffic to support advertising and sponsorships? Once you know the main goal of the website content you’re producing, you’ll be better positioned to write copy that will help achieve that goal.

                                But before you even write one word of content for a website, know who you’re writing it for.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Step 2: <br>
                                Research the Audience
Remember: You’re writing for human readers. People! What you say and how you say it will depend on such things as:

Their level of expertise. If you expect to be speaking to experts in your website copy, you’re going to use different language than if you’re speaking to novices.
What they really want to know. This is core to writing effective website content because if you can answer their questions better than anyone else, you have a greater chance of winning them as a customer.
How they will get to the page. Understanding where your users come from or what they may be searching for when they land on your page can guide how you position your content.
Their interests. Knowing what your audience is interested in beyond the landing page you’re creating can help you know what elements to add to your website content to keep them engaged on your site.
<br>
<br>
Step 3:<br>
 Research Competing Websites
Good website content writing depends on a well-rounded view of the competitive landscape. Comparing your site to your competitors’ yields important insights that will impact the website copy you write. Here’s why:

Your visitors are visiting your competitors’ websites, too. Learn what they’re reading there, so you can take a stance or offer something different — better — on your website.
It will help you identify industry trends in website content. You will be able to spot strategic shifts or new tactics competitors are trying early on, rather than being the last to know.
You can use competitor data to benchmark your performance. Get a sense of the traffic, backlinks, and keywords your competitors’ sites rank for, so you can set realistic goals to measure against each month.
 It can inspire new content topics to write about. You’ll be thankful to have a source of ideas at your fingertips.
This exploratory phase helps you evaluate your options before you write.                            
<br>
<br>
Step 4:<br>
 Plan How the Content Fits Together on Your Website
Before you step into website content writing, make sure there’s a plan for how all the pages work together.

If you’re overhauling a website or creating a new one, you might find it useful to create a wireframe. This can be as simple as sketching out a list of pages and the topics they’ll cover.

Think through:

What pages you’ll need and the purpose of each
How people will navigate to each page
Website content comes in a variety of shapes and sizes. From long-form content and blog posts to sidebar blurbs and product descriptions, copy is prepared and displayed in varied ways to serve different purposes.
<br>
<br>
Step 5:<br>
Now it’s time to dig into the steps to writing copy for your web pages. Start by understanding the purpose of the page you’re going to write.

Define the Purpose of the Page.

Before you write content for a page on your website, decide what purpose the page will serve. Different pages will have different goals. When thinking through how to write your website content, make sure the copy on each page serves its intended purpose.

For example, your home page serves as a main entrance to your site and helps people understand who you are and what you do at a glance. That means your home page content needs to give people a little bit of information about the most important concepts and help people find where to go next.

You may be writing website content for landing pages, too. Unbounce describes landing pages as pages that have “been designed for a single, focused objective.” They are designed to lead the user to take action and are created for one of the following purposes:

Click-throughs: a page designed to lead the user to another web page
Lead generation: a page designed to lead the user to enter their information in an opt-in form
Purchase: a page designed to lead the user to make a purchase
Blog posts are website content, too, but their purpose is usually to educate and build brand awareness. They are time-stamped pages often related to something topical, timely, seasonal, or newsworthy, whereas landing pages are typically evergreen pages.

Some of your pages may be designed to bring in traffic from people who are searching online. If the purpose of your content is to bring in searchers, choose a good keyword to target in your writing.
</p>
<p style="color: brown;">
    Step 6: <br>
    Add Non-Copy Page Elements
Website content writing guidelines include more than just copy. To create strong, high-converting landing pages and other website content, pay attention to the non-copy elements on the page as well. Insert visuals that show concepts (instead of relying on the words to describe them).

You can break up the page and draw the reader’s eye to important information by using:

Images
Buttons
Text call-outs
Icons
White space
Gifs
Charts and graphs
Videos
Line breaks
Variations in background colors and images
<br>
<br>
Step 7:<br>
Make Edits
Once you’ve written a page’s content, set it aside, even for just a few hours. When you come back to it with fresh eyes, you’ll see ways to improve it.

At this point, you’ll probably find opportunities to:

Correct typos
Improve weak word choices
Rewrite sections that are unclear
Strengthen the headline
Link to other content on your site
You may be surprised at what jumps out at you. This is also a good time to optimize your website content for SEO.
Step 8:<br>
Optimize the Page for SEO
Depending on the purpose of the page, you may want users to find it through search. So as you write content for website pages, use SEO best practices that will help your page rank for your main keyword.

Use the primary keyword naturally throughout the content.

Once you write your content, go back through it and make sure you used your keyword throughout the copy. A keyword density of about 1-2% is ideal, as it is enough to tell search engines what the page is about without stuffing the page with too many uses of the same word, which can negatively affect your ability to rank in search engines.
<br>
<br>
Step 9:<br>
 Plan to Update Content Later
If you’re learning how to write content for a website, you might be surprised to hear that your work is really just beginning at this point. It’s important to keep your site content fresh, and now is a great time to plan how you’ll update it later.

Consider A/B Testing Landing Page Content on Your Website.

Especially when writing focused landing pages, you should test different versions of your page to see which creates the most conversions (the percentage of users who complete the desired action on the page).
